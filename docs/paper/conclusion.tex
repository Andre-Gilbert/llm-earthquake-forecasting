\chapter{Conclusion}\label{ch:conclusion}
To conclude, the project was successfully completed and its goals were achieved. We pre-processed the data and trained a robust model, which was then used to build a comprehensive application. This application features a dashboard displaying recent earthquakes and an interactive map showing future earthquakes for the next three days worldwide. Given the extensive volume of the presented data, which might seem overwhelming, we developed an AI Agent to increase accessibility. This agent allows users to run personalized forecasts tailored to their specific needs. Since most users are interested in one or two regions rather than all 25 regions which are covered by the forecast, this feature is particularly useful. Additionally, the AI Agent acts as a \ac{USGS} expert, providing users with in-depth analysis on potential risks and safety precautions for individual earthquakes.

Recognizing that many people are not tech-savvy and aiming to spread information about earthquakes to a broad audience, we minimized technical barriers. By integrating an interactive AI Agent, we made it easier for users to access and understand crucial earthquake information.

To enhance the predictive accuracy of earthquake forecasting models, several potential improvements can be considered. Integrating live data such as magma flow, plate tectonics movements, and real-time seismic activity could provide a more comprehensive and dynamic understanding of the underlying processes that precede earthquakes. Additionally, exploring advanced deep learning models, such as \ac{RNNs} and \ac{LSTM}s, which are well-suited for time series data, might offer improved prediction capabilities by capturing complex temporal dependencies. Furthermore, incorporating multi-source data fusion techniques, which combine various types of geological and environmental data, could enhance the robustness of the model. Continuous updates and retraining of the model with the latest data, along with cross-disciplinary collaboration between seismologists and data scientists, would also contribute to refining the forecasting accuracy. These improvements could collectively help in better anticipating seismic events, despite the inherent challenges in predicting such random and chaotic phenomena.
