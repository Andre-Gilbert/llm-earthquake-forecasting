\chapter*{Abstract}

Earthquakes are a common, yet sometimes catastrophic, phenomenon in our world.
Approximately 2,000 earthquakes with a magnitude of 5 on the Richter scale
occur annually \parencite{welt_erdbeben}. As this threat frequently endangers
many lives, we aim to improve response time and enhance public understanding
of earthquakes, particularly how to act in extreme situations. To achieve this,
we have developed a CatBoost model to forecast the magnitude and depth of
upcoming earthquakes for the 25 most vulnerable regions over the next three days.
Our model achieves a \ac{MSE} of 2.9344, a \ac{RMSE} of 10.3577, and an R2-Score
of 0.9495. Additionally, we have developed a \ac{LLM}-powered AI agent,
enabling user interaction with the model results and
providing answers to general questions about earthquakes to improve awareness and
in-depth analysis of potential risks and safety measures. This project contributes
to the field of forecasting research by exemplifying the use case of a categorical
boosted tree model to forecast earthquakes.
