\chapter*{Abstract}

Earthquakes are a common, yet sometimes catastrophic, phenomenon in our world. Approximately 2,000 earthquakes with a magnitude of 5 on the Richter scale occur annually \parencite{welt_erdbeben}. As this threat frequently endangers many lives, we aim to improve response time and enhance public understanding of earthquakes, particularly how to act in extreme situations. We have developed a CatBoost model to predict the magnitude and depth of an upcoming earthquake within the next three days for the 25 most vulnerable regions. Our model achieves a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 2.9344, a Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) of 10.3577, and an R2-Score of 0.9495. Additionally, we have developed a \ac{LLM}-powered AI agent, enabling user interaction with the model results and providing answers to general questions about earthquakes to improve awareness and in-depth analysis of potential risks and safety measures. This project contributes to the field of forecasting research by exemplifying the use case of a categorical boosted tree model to forecast earthquakes.
