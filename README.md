# llm-earthquake-forecasting

This project aims to develop a real-time earthquake monitoring web application using machine learning. The application will forecast earthquake magnitudes and depths by employing a CatBoost regression model trained on USGS earthquake data. Additionally, the project includes the integration of an LLM-powered AI agent designed to answer earthquake-related questions. This AI agent simulates the expertise of a United States Geological Survey (USGS) expert and incorporates various tools for earthquake information and forecasting to enhance its responses.
